A small library app. Allows users to add books to their "library" and mark them as either read or unread. Book objects are stored in a library array, which is then saved to the user's local storage. This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum. The exercise teaches setting up and using Javascript objects. Additionally for me, this was also a great review of DOM manipulation and taught the basics of using local storage.
